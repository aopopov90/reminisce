# Logging Configuration
# logLevel controls the amount of logging information generated. If not set, the default logLevel is INFO.
# Valid values, from least amount of logging to most, are:
#   OFF, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, ALL
# If you are having problems, setting the logLevel to DEBUG and re-running the command can be helpful.
# logLevel: DEBUG

# The logFile property controls where logging messages are sent. If this is not set, then logging messages are
# displayed on the console. If this is set, then messages will be sent to a file with the given name.
# logFile: liquibase.log
